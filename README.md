# Commerce Payments Protocol

A permissionless protocol for onchain payments that mimics traditional "authorize and capture" payment flows. Built for Base blockchain in collaboration with Shopify to enable onchain express checkout.

## Quick Start

The Commerce Payments Protocol facilitates secure escrow-based payments with flexible authorization and capture patterns. Operators drive payment flows using modular token collectors while the protocol ensures buyer and merchant protections.

## Key Features

- **Two-Phase Payments**: Separate authorization and capture for guaranteed merchant payments
- **Flexible Fee Structure**: Configurable fee rates and recipients within predefined ranges  
- **Modular Token Collection**: Support for multiple authorization methods (ERC-3009, Permit2, allowances, spend permissions)
- **Built-in Protections**: Time-based expiries, amount limits, and reclaim mechanisms
- **Operator Model**: Permissionless operators manage payment flows while remaining trust-minimized
